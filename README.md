# CQuest

My work for a game jam - intended to be made into a small rpg engine in c supporting dynamic content and mods.

For the game jam, I just intend to get battles/dueling simulated in a very basic way. Possibly some basic menus. Hopefully attack combinations and player/monster stats.

## Compilation

    cd source
    make

## Running

    usage: ./cquest <mode>
    modes: battle, graphics, filereader, atacks
